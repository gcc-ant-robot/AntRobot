# Repository Folder Explanation

In the root directory of this repository, there are currently 4 folders: `object-tracker_DrAnderson/`, `PreliminaryDevelopmentCode/`, and `TestingObjectRecodnitionAlgorithims/`, and `CurrentMyRIOApp/`.

The `object_tracker_DrAnderson/` folder contains the code originally given to us by Dr. Anderson.

The `PreliminaryDevelopmentCode/` folder contains the code that I wrote while learning how to use the Vision Package as well as an initial State Machine MyRio app which rasteres an image from a camera in search for a laser dot.

The `TestingObjectRecodnitionAlgorithims/` folder contains two different approaches to detecting a laser dot which were developed to compare runtimes and find the fastest method.

Finaly, the `CurrentMyRIOApp/` directory contains a labview myRIO project and which is intended to house the "current development area" - it is intended to be the main myRIO program for the semester.
