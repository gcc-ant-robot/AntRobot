# Repository Folder Explanation

In the root directory of this repository, there are currently 3 folders: `object-tracker_DrAnderson/`, `PreliminaryDevelopmentCode/`, and `TestingObjectRecodnitionAlgorithims/`.

The `object_tracker_DrAnderson/` folder contains the code originally given to us by Dr. Anderson.

The `PreliminaryDevelopmentCode/` folder contains the code that I wrote while learning how to use the Vision Package as well as an initial State Machine MyRio app which rasteres an image from a camera in search for a laser dot.

Finaly, The `TestingObjectRecodnitionAlgorithims/` folder contains two different approaches to detecting a laser dot which were developed to compare runtimes and find the fastest method.
